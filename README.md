Welcome to our free online Docker course, the perfect place to master a powerful technology used all over the world. The course is designed for people with no prior docker experience and will be a great opportunity for every developer. Doesn’t matter if you prefer java, python, golang or javascript, containers are widely used in any part of the Software Development world: Docker skills aren’t the option anymore but the requirement!

The Docker Learning Path consists of 4 weeks as explained in the schedule below. Each class is 90 minutes plus you will need around 45 minutes to do the exercises: it takes some time but the best investment is the investment in yourself! Register for the event, attend the course, do the homework and fill the final submission form to get your own very well deserved “Docker Upgrade Complete” Achievement.

### What we will cover
* Containers, why you may need them and how they help
* Docker Fundamentals: general principles and use-cases
* Basic Operations: running a container, building an image etc.
* Image Repositories: push, pull, etc.
* Advanced Scenarios: docker setup for complex systems and applications
* Application Development with Docker
* Security in Containers: stay safe!
* Tips on where to go next to continue your learning
