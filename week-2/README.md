### Assignment
1. This time you have to do a more complex setup using docker-compose. It should include at least one predefined image from hub.docker.com (like a database) and one custom image you build on your own. It should use bind mounts or volumes so `docker-compose down` will not wipe out data. Please use our examples of [wordpress](./wordpress) and [voting application](./voting-app) for the inspiration.
2. If possible, publish your code from p.1 on github by creating a new issue at https://github.com/datastaxdevs/docker-learning-path/issues/new/choose. It may not be an option if you containerised a proprietary project, but please proceed to step III anyway.
3. Open the issues list at https://github.com/datastaxdevs/docker-learning-path/issues, pick one not taken project, write a comment that you have "taken" it. Review the project and think on how would you improve it. Write down your suggestions in the issue. Feel free to review multiple projects, also feel free to review a taken one - more opinions is better! Stay polite!
4. If you want us to review your assignment publicly, send an issue link to me as well! We will pick some projects to discuss during week III. We cover both mistakes and good decisions. :) 
5. Add me on linkedin. We spend together over 4 hours already so let's celebrate it! [linkedin.com/in/volochnev/](https://linkedin.com/in/volochnev/)
