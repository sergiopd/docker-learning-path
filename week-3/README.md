### Assignment

We proceed with the assignment of the Week II

1. Use the Week II Task I as a first step. Then improve it following this week steps: env variables, github actions or travis build, tests, etc. Please use our week II samples for the inspiration.
2. If possible and ig it's not done yet, publish your code from p.1 on github in your repository. Create a new issue at [github.com/datastaxdevs/docker-learning-path/issues](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/docker-learning-path/issues). It may not be an option if you containerised a proprietary project, but please proceed to step III anyway.
3. Choose an issue from the list, write a comment that you have "taken" it. Review the project and think on how would you improve it. Write down your suggestions in the issue. Feel free to review multiple projects, also feel free to review a taken one! Stay polite!
4. If you want us to review your assignment publicly, send an issue link to me! We will pick some projects to discuss during week IV. We cover both mistakes and good decisions. :)
